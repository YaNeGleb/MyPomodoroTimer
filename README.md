Using the Pomodoro timer can significantly increase your productivity. The advantages of this technique include:

• Increased productivity

• Reduced stress and improved health

• Reduced distracting factors.

App Features

• Customizable timer - it allows you to modify the default Pomodoro configuration based on your personal preferences.

• Desktop notification - once enabled, you will get desktop notifications from time to time

• Dark theme - it allows you to use dark mode and helps you reduce eye strain and improves visibility if you are the type of person with low vision and high sensitivity to bright light.
